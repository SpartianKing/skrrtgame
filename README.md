	- Users a part of any guild will have 5% of their loot drops or an equivalant sent to the guild's private bank account. This is to ensure that the guild always has backup funds to pay for expenses like monthly tax, or entrance fees into any events or entry into certain towns and cities. 
	- Guild members will have access to exclusive guild stores, which they can purchase items typically bought at merchant stalls for 25% off. This is 25% off of any items/potions/food/armor/skills/etc.
	- Guild members will have a guild flag displayed next to their names, as well as the guild name (if possible displayed above their username)
	- Guild houses will have a ~250-500/month tax for ownership of the house and if after a month that no activity has been recorded for any of the players, the tax of 250-500/month will be paused but will resume if a member of the guild joins back into the game and enters the guild house/respawns at guild house. If a user does not enter or use the guild house the tax will be paused. Only the guild master is taxed for the house, but its individual for entry into events or certain towns/cities. Other guild members can pay for entry into events or certain towns/cities.
